# Moment 4 DT207G Part 2

This project is part of Moment 4 -  *"Autentisering och s√§kerhet"* in the course Backend-baserad webbutveckling (DT207G) at Mittuniversitetet, Sundsvall. 

This is a simple frontend site built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that interacts with a backend API to incorporate user authentication and access-controlled content. The backend API can be found here: **[API](https://github.com/gustafsson96/moment4dt207g.git)** and is created specifically for this assignment.

## API Interaction
* **Login:** The user's credentials are sent to the /api/login endpoint via a POST request. If successful, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is returned and stored in localStorage, which is used to access the protected page. 

* **Registration:** New users can sign up by selecting a username and password that is sent to the /api/register endpoint via a POST request. The backend handles validation (correct length and that the user does not already exist) and user creation. A JSON Web Token is returned if user registration is successful. 

* **Protected Content:** After logging in, users are redirected to a page displaying fun facts that are collected from the API. This page can only be accessed by a user with a valid JWT.
